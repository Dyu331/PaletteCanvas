This project is called Palette Canvas, a mobile app created using Apple's Xcode and the SwiftUI.

The purpose of this app is to teach Basic Color Theory using famous paintings. The goal is for users to create palettes interactively using the color picker. For each level, the user will learn the history of the selected painting, and then recreate a color palette of the painting through the color picker. I created 5 levels, each with a different fundamental color theory (primary colors, complimentary colors, etc) and a painting that demonstrate that concept. Upon completing the level, users can check out the color palette and get more specific informations on it. 
The next step would be to link this app to the internet. For example, the user could upload a image of their choice, and this app could use the internet to determine the paintings color palette and supply that information to the user. 

I created this project in 2023 for the Apple Student Swift Challenge and was selected as one of the winners.
